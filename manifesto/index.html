    <h1>A humane manifesto</h1>

<p>Aimed at the UK. Written in one morning, with no regard for economics. 2025-08-11.</p>

<h2>Recognise that:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>people are both independent and interdependent</li>
    <li>we can't live without the natural world</li>
    <li>humanity is what makes our lives important</li>
    <li>trust is based on transparency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aim to:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Create a stable, sustainable, rational society, in which people work for societal and personal fulfilment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short term focus:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>democratisation
        <ul>
            <li>fair representation: alternative vote or similar</li>
            <li>two elected houses: 1) by region, to represent people, 2) by organisation, to represent interests</li>
            <li>honesty in all campaigning</li>
            <li>no outside income for representatives - any income creates conflicts of interest</li>
            <li>separation of state from monarchy and from church</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>transparency of commerce
        <ul>
            <li>brands must be transparent - who owns, who manufactures, who takes responsibility</li>
            <li>adverts may not say or imply anything that they cannot offer</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>simplification of finance
        <ul>
            <li>no over-complicated business structures</li>
            <li>no HFT, no complex derivatives, etc</li>
            <li>companies should not act outside their defined purpose</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>less waste
        <ul>
            <li>no importation of mass-produced, low quality items</li>
            <li>reduction of disposable items of all kinds</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>community projects
        <ul>
            <li>supplies, locations, organisational tools, etc made available for volunteer organisations</li>
            <li>using land to support people, not cars</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>enforcement of responsibilities
        <ul>
            <li>failure to follow road rules -&gt; no right to drive</li>
            <li>corruption -&gt; no right to hold authority</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Longer term goals:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>more honesty, more rationality, less manipulation, no corruption
        <ul>
            <li>any person or organisation with power must be open about how it operates</li>
            <li>anti-rational organisations to be marginalised</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>education with a focus on evidence-based decision making
        <ul>
            <li>everyone taught to consider, and to reject dogma</li>
            <li>life-long learning to the norm, with education available at all ages</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>simplification of regulation, with more community involvement
        <ul>
            <li>if people are willing to take part in discussion and democracy, then regulation can be lighter</li>
            <li>those who attempt to avoid the spirit of regulations must be punished</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>shared ownership of essential utilities: health, water, power, communication, transport
        <ul>
            <li>an essential service should not seek to extract profit</li>
            <li>non-essential commerce will continue as ever, within restrictions on advertising etc as mentioned</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>reduce interaction with non-aligned societies
        <ul>
            <li>no arms exports to theocrats or dictatorships; eventually no trade with them at all</li>
            <li>support interaction with individuals in such places</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>encourage and support interaction between individuals and between societies, e.g. through common languages
        <ul>
            <li>alienation of individuals or of groups must be avoided everywhere</li>
            <li>people should be able to communicate fully and freely, without need for machine mediation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>reduce consumption
        <ul>
            <li>people should have a path to fulfilment that does not depend on wasting resources</li>
            <li>encourage people to recognise that the drive to have new things is caused by manipulation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>advancements to be shared
        <ul>
            <li>aiming to reduce obligatory work through automation and elimination</li>
            <li>if an advance can fundamentally change society for the better, then it must be done for the benefit of everyone</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>wealth shall be limited if necessary
        <ul>
            <li>there should not be a need to acquire huge wealth when there is less to consume</li>
            <li>but if people try anyway, they should be limited</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>no obligatory labour, except for a fair share of essential work
        <ul>
            <li>work should be done for the purpose of achieving personal or shared goals</li>
            <li>if a person is forced to do an unfulfilling job for lack of options, society as a whole is not fulfilled</li>
            <li>society needs people to do essential work, and to support social goals - those unwilling or unsuited may choose to support in other ways</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
